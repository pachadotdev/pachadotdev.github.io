        <h2>Datasets</h2>

        <h3 id="freedomhouse">Freedom House</h3>

        <p>I have provided an Excel version of the Freedom House datasets in the R package "freedomhouse" 
            <a href="https://github.com/pachadotdev/freedomhouse/raw/main/exported-spreadsheets/freedom-house-excel.zip">here</a>.
            The added value is that it tidied the data from their spreadsheets and I added the ISO codes fo the countries and the justification text
            for each sub-item where those were available. Check <a href="https://pacha.dev/freedomhouse">here</a> for more details.
        </p>

        <h3 id="gravitydatasets">Gravity Datasets</h3>

        <p>The tables provided here were reshaped under Cobb's Normal Form, and in some cases contain corrections that I
            explain in the <a href="https://github.com/pachadotdev/gravitydatasets">project repository</a>. The specific
            sources are the Gravity database from the Center for Prospective Studies and International Information
            (CEPII),
            the International Trade and Production Database for Estimation (ITPD-E) and the Dynamic Gravity Database
            (DGD)
            from the US International Trade Commission (USITC), and the Structural Gravity Database (SGD) from the World
            Trade Organization (WTO).</p>

        <h3 id="open-trade-statistics">Open Trade Statistics</h3>

        <p>Since 2017 I've maintained <a href="https://tradestatistics.io">Open Trade Statistics</a>, a project created
            with
            the intention to lower the barrier to working with international economic trade data. It includes a public
            API,
            a dashboard, and an R package for data retrieval. The project started when I was affected by the fact that
            many
            Latin American Universities have limited or no access to the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics
            Database
            (UN COMTRADE).</p>

        <p>OTS provides a curated database derived from UN COMTRADE. I can provide a full SQL dump of the database or
            share
            subsets of the database for the period 2002-2020 aggregated by countries or by products up to a detail of
            six
            digits in the Harmonised System revision 2012.</p>

        <p>After contacting UN COMTRADE, and suggesting to them my idea of sharing trade data but keeping commercial
            purposes out of the scope of the project, I got an authorization to share curated versions of their
            datasets.
        </p>

        <h3 id="sql">SQL Databases for students and educators</h3>

        <p>Check <a href="https://databases.pacha.dev/">SQL Databases for students and educators</a> if you need access
            to
            PostgreSQL databases.</p>

        <p>Publicly accessible databases often impose query limits or require registration. Even when I maintain public
            and
            limit-free APIs, I never wanted to host a public database because the connection string can be problematic
            for
            users.</p>
