            I am a PhD student in Political Science at the University of
            Toronto, specializing in International Relations and Public Policy.
            My research primarily focuses on the political dynamics of trade
            agreements and sanctions. Due to this interest, I am a Fellow at the
            <a href="https://munkschool.utoronto.ca/">Munk School of Global
                Affairs and Public Policy</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            My academic background includes a Master of Arts in Political
            Science from the University of Toronto, a Master of Science in
            Statistics from the Catholic University of Chile, and an Engineering
            degree from the University of Chile. Should you need it, I can
            provide my academic and professional CV upon request. For any
            queries or further information, please contact me at
            <span id="email"></span>.

            I am convinced that a comprehensive understanding of economic and
            financial sanctions between countries can be achieved by integrating
            ideas, interests, institutions, and structures. I aim at studying
            this combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Econometrics to
            analyze and quantify the economic repercussions of sanctions. This
            is detailed in the 
            <a href="javascript:showDiv('research')">Research</a> section.
        </p>

        <p>
            My research interest has led me to develop advanced R, Python, and
            C++ skills. My <a href="https://github.com/pachadotdev">GitHub</a>
            profile showcases my open-source projects, predominantly focused on
            gravity estimation, data wrangling in R, and data visualization
            using Shiny. More details can be found in the
            <a href="javascript:showDiv('open-source')">Open Source</a> section.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, I maintain a blog (<a href="https://pacha.dev/blog">
                pacha.dev/blog</a>), where I post various notes and tutorials.
            Some highlights include "Creating LaTeX Figures with Inkscape", "A
            Crash Course on PostgreSQL for R Users", and "A Step-by-Step Guide
            to Write an R Package that Uses C++ Code (Ubuntu)". These posts
            reflect my ongoing commitment to both learning and sharing knowledge
            in the field.
