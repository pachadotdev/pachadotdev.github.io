                    I am a PhD student in Political Science at the University of
                    Toronto, specializing in International Relations and Public Policy.
                    My research primarily focuses on the political dynamics of trade
                    agreements and sanctions. Due to this interest, I am a Fellow at the
                    <a href="https://munkschool.utoronto.ca/">Munk School of Global
                        Affairs and Public Policy</a>. My research covers a significant
                    Open Source component, which led me to contribute as a Junior Editor
                    for the <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/">Journal of Open Source Software</a>.

                    My academic background includes a Master of Arts in Political
                    Science from the University of Toronto, a Master of Science in
                    Statistics from the Catholic University of Chile, and an Engineering
                    degree from the University of Chile. Should you need it, I can
                    provide my academic and professional CV upon request. For any

                    I am convinced that a comprehensive understanding of economic and
                    financial sanctions between countries can be achieved by integrating
                    ideas, interests, institutions, and structures. I aim at studying
                    this combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Econometrics to
                    analyze and quantify the economic repercussions of sanctions. This
                    is detailed in the 
                    <a href="research.html">Research</a> section and in my research

                    My research interest has led me to develop advanced R, Python, and
                    C++ skills. My <a href="https://github.com/pachadotdev">GitHub</a>
                    profile showcases my open-source projects, predominantly focused on
                    gravity estimation, data wrangling in R, and data visualization
                    using Shiny. I have created Open Source implementations for efficient
                    gravity estimation, including published articles about it. More
                    details can be found in the <a href="open-source.html">Open Source</a>
                    and <a href="Research">Research</a> sections.

                    I am deeply interested in replication work, which has motivated me
                    to replicate the results from books and articles in international trade
                    and political economy. For more details, see the
                    <a href="replication.html">Replication</a> section where I added
                    step-by-step independent R codes and math for
                    <i>Advanced International Trade</i>, <i>The Impact of Trade on Intra-Industry Reallocations and Aggregate Industry Productivity</i>,
                    <i>The Log of Gravity</i>, and <i>An Advanced Guide to Trade Policy Analysis: The Structural Gravity Model</i>.

                    Additionally, I maintain a blog (<a href="https://pacha.dev/blog">
                    pacha.dev/blog</a>), where I post various notes and tutorials.
                    Some highlights include "Creating LaTeX Figures with Inkscape", "A
                    Crash Course on PostgreSQL for R Users", and "A Step-by-Step Guide
                    to Write an R Package that Uses C++ Code (Ubuntu)". These posts
                    reflect my ongoing commitment to both learning and sharing knowledge
                    in the field.

        <h2>Research Statement</h2>

        <p>
            Since the end of World War II, sanctions have increased in number, but
            their effectiveness has decreased (The Economist 2021), which raises
            the question whether policy makers implement sanctions to satisfy
            domestic coalitions or achieve other goals. The economic
            consequences of sanctions can be explored at the sectoral level,
            distinguishing categories such as agriculture, energy,
            manufacturing, mining, and services. The current political and
            economic order justifies the need to account for the interdependence
            between different sectors of a national economy in global trade
            (Sbragia 2011).</p>
        
        <p>
            I propose the thesis project "Trade Sanctions and Rule-Making,"
            where I shall answer the question "Who wins and who loses with
            sanctions?" I will focus on trade sanctions between political
            allies and the variation of effects between industries. This will
            uncover general patterns about how these mechanisms work, and to
            explain why and when policymakers deviate from World Trade
            Organization practices that reduce global trade uncertainty. The
            project is relevant due to the spiking complexity of global
            sanctions (Morgan, Syropoulos, and Yotov 2022; Coates 2019; Ossa
            2014) and the rise of protectionism (Walter 2021; Felbermayr et al.
            2020).
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I intend to explore how Generalized Linear Models, in particular the
            Structural Gravity Model (Wölwer et al. 2018),
            can be used to computationally simulate the impact of political
            decisions, such as a sanction being implemented. This model shows
            how the resulting changes in one sector in one country causes a
            chain reaction with consequences in GDP and other measures of
            economic welfare for third party countries (Vargas Sepulveda 2024;
            Yotov et al. 2017). At the present time I have published articles
            and their corresponding software that provide the open source
            infrastructure to conduct this work (Vargas Sepulveda 2025; Vargas
            Sepulveda and Schneider Malamud 2025; Vargas Sepulveda 2025; 2024a).
        </p>

        <p>	
            I aim to corroborate and expand existing sanctions databases
            (Felbermayr et al. 2020) and commodities trade data (Borchert et al.
            2021). I intend to produce accurate sectoral trade databases for
            most of or all UN countries. One core feature of my work will be
            correcting mismatches in the data between importers and exporters,
            and cover as many gaps as possible by using administrative data from
            the UN and state-of-the-art linear models for imputation.
        </p>

        <p>	
            A comprehensive depiction at the sectoral level will enable me to
            study specific sanctions’ impact and explore how policy toolkits
            affect different actors, ideas, and institutions (Lasswell 1970),
            and to balance theory and information-gathering (Simeon 1976). My
            contribution will be to integrate our political and economic
            understanding of sanctions, by creating a methodology to estimate
            the impact of sanctions that policy makers could use to evaluate the
            effectiveness, success, and impact of their agendas.
