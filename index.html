<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>

<p>I am a statistician interested in applying statistical methods to address specific policy-relevant questions, particularly in 
    international trade, migration, investments and theoretically founded empirical work. These interests led me to create a 
    consistent line of <a href="#selected-r-packages">R packages</a> to provide datasets and estimation methods useful for 
    researchers interested in International Trade and affine disciplines.</p>

<p>I am completing a Master in Political Science at UofT, where I enrolled in the core courses in Public Policy, alongside the 
    methods track for policy and politics research. I hold a Master in Statistics from <a href="https://www.uc.cl/en">Universidad 
    Católica de Chile</a> (distinction and honors), and a professional degree (5 years diploma) in Business Engineering (i.e., 
    Business and Economics) from the University of Chile.</p>

<p>To contact me, send me an email to hello+spam@pacha.dev (i.e., use +r, +training, +tutoring, etc. and I&#39;ll see your email 
    fast enough). I can provide my CV (academic/profesional) upon request.</p>

<p>Follow me on <a rel="me" href="https://mastodonsocial.ca/@pacha">Mastodon</a>! I created a new instance called Mastodon Social. 
    I also have <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1017-7574">ORCID</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pachadotdev">GitHub</a> 
    profiles.</p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

<p>My main research interests and contributions are in three interrelated areas: (i) Political economy of trade policies; 
    (ii) Gravity estimation and efficient software implementations; and (iii) Efficient data access, interrelated areas directly 
    linked to the Sustainable Development goals of <a href="https://www.un-ilibrary.org/content/sdgs/sdg9">Industry, Innovation and 
    Infrastructure</a> and <a href="https://www.un-ilibrary.org/content/sdgs/sdg16">Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions</a>.</p>

<p>For my thesis for the Master in Political Science, I am working on each of these topics, with a focus in reproducibility. I 
    prepared a preprint on arXiv, <a href=" 	arXiv:2209.14748">Economic effects of Chile FTAs and an eventual CTPP accession</a>, 
    using aggregated data, to illustrate the general idea.</p>

<h3 id="political-economy-of-trade-policies">Political economy of trade policies</h3>

<p>My main interest is to explore the distributional consequences of trade policy changes at industry and sector levels. 
    The global economic interdependence justifies measuring the effect of trade policy changes in one market and how 
    this will trigger ripple effects in the rest of the world. Economic gains or losses are not homogeneous at sub-national level,
    and are often highly correlated with industries or sectors geographically dispersed because of especialization.</p>

<p>I am interested in studying existing agreements, observed tariffs, non-tariff measures (NTMs), and bilateral trade flow to produce 
    knowledge that countries can use to negociate or expand their agreements intelligently. My central questions are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Which are the decomposed effects (i.e. GDP changes from one province) of the trade policy?</li>
    <li>Which commodities should be present in tarrifs negotiation?</li>
    <li>Which is the ideal timing to face trade-induced unemployment with industry protection and reconverting the workforce?</li>
    <li>Can we use NTMs to achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?</li>
</ul>

<p>Trade policy also covers sanctions, whose application aims at destabiling a dictatorship, preventing war or protecting human 
    rights in a country. I ask myself about the efficacy of those measures and who finally pays the costs of those sanctions, but I 
    also ask myself how to tailor sanctions to maximize their efectiveness.</p>

<h3 id="gravity-estimation-and-efficient-software-implementations">Gravity estimation and efficient software implementations</h3>

<p>One of the challenges in gravity modeling is to produce theoretically consistent models that are also computationally efficient. 
    For  masters in Statistics' thesis I replicated all the models in the book 
    <a href="https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/publications_e/advancedguide2016_e.htm">An Advanced Guide to Trade Policy Analysis</a> 
    and writing open source software for specific gravity modeling including clustered standard errors and misspecification tests.</p>

<p>In  this line, I have written the R package <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gravity">gravity</a>, with its corresponding 
    <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.01038">article</a>, which implements different methods available in the 
    literature. It covers Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood (PPML), OLS, Logit and other classic methods, with the idea of providing 
    policy makers with easy to use software that allows them to focus on the evaluation of initiatives such as subscribing or 
    expanding a Free Trade Agreement.</p>

<p>I write open source software because Least Developed Countries (LDCs) face limited resources for commercial software and 
    computational power, and they lack the required analytical capacity to formulate evidence-based policies and assess their impacts. I 
    believe I can make a contribution to strengthening analytical capacity of LDCs to conduct analysis of impact of trade policy 
    towards sustainable development.</p>

<h3 id="efficient-data-access">Efficient data access</h3>

<p>I intend to summarise gigabytes of data into country and product profiles for academics and policymakers interested in trade. 
    Since 2017, I’ve maintained the project <a href="#open-trade-statistics">Open Trade Statistics</a>, where I provide free access 
    to curated trade data based on the United Nations trade statistics.</p>

<p>I’ve created R packages to easily access 
    <a href="https://github.com/pachadotdev/desta">The Design of Trade Agreements Database (DESTA)</a>, the 
    <a href="https://github.com/pachadotdev/usitcgravity">International Trade and Production Database for Estimation (ITPD-E)</a>, 
    and other affine datasets.</p>

<p>This line of work aims at easing data access to help to facilitate research, and has required me to master R, C++ and SQL, 
    therefore I have computational skills more common in software engineering rather than Political Science or Statistics</p>

<h2 id="r-and-shiny-training">R and Shiny training</h2>

<p>I offer short courses for groups and individual personalized sessions at <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/pacha/extras">Buy Me a Coffee</a>. I am a certified Tidyverse and Shiny instructor by <a href="https://education.rstudio.com/trainers">RStudio</a> and a Software Carpentry Instructor with a Carpentries certification.</p>

<h3 id="cran">CRAN</h3>

<p>I maintain the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/WebTechnologies.html">WebTechnologies</a> view and the official mirror for <a href="https://cran.dcc.uchile.cl">Chile</a>.</p>

<h3 id="latex">LaTeX</h3>

<p>I created the R package <a href="https://github.com/pachadotdev/varsityblues">varsityblues</a>, which allow you to write assignments, presentations and thesis in RStudio by following UofT style rules. Its advantage is that avoids the need to copy and paste tables or plots from R outputs into Word/LaTeX documents, instead it allows to work with notebooks that you can export to PDF, and it installs/configures LaTeX setup automatically.</p>

<p>This package is based on the LaTeX style files that that late professor <a href="https://kcborder.caltech.edu/">Kim C. Border</a> once sent to me.</p>

<h3 id="cloud-computing">Cloud computing</h3>

<p>I created images for <a href="https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/rstudio">RStudio Server</a> and <a href="https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/rstudio-kubernetes">RStudio Server + Kubernetes</a>, which allow you to create virtual machines on <a href="https://m.do.co/c/1d5a471e5f54">DigitalOcean</a> and to skip the setup time to install the Tidyverse and other packages. With these images, it takes around 30 seconds to have a ready to go setup for Data Science. This combines well with <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=analogsea">analogsea</a> as I explained in my <a href="https://pacha.dev/blog/2021/07/17/analogsea-using-arrow-s3-and-digitalocean-for-efficient-model-fitting-in-rstudio/">blog</a>.</p>

<p>In simple terms, this allows you to rent a supercomputer, for example, with 48 cores and 200 GB in RAM, for a reasonable price.</p>

<h2 id="datasets">Datasets</h2>

<h3 id="open-trade-statistics">Open Trade Statistics</h3>

<p>Since 2017 I've maintained <a href="https://tradestatistics.io">Open Trade Statistics</a>, a project created with the intention to lower the barrier to working with international economic trade data. It includes a public API, a dashboard, and an R package for data retrieval. The project started when I was affected by the fact that many Latin American Universities have limited or no access to the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN COMTRADE).</p>

<p>OTS provides a curated database derived from UN COMTRADE. I can provide a full SQL dump of the database or share subsets of the database for the period 2002-2020 aggregated by countries or by products up to a detail of six digits in the Harmonised System revision 2012.</p>

<p>After contacting UN COMTRADE, and suggesting to them my idea of doing something similar to BACI but available for anyone but keeping commercial purposes out of the scope of the project, I got an authorization to share curated versions of their datasets.</p>

<h3 id="sql">SQL Databases for students and educators</h3>

<p>Check <a href="https://databases.pacha.dev/">SQL Databases for students and educators</a> if you need access to PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQL Server databases (in strictly descending order of preference!).</p>

<p>Publicly accessible databases often impose query limits or require registration. Even when I maintain public and limit-free APIs, I never wanted to host a public database because I tend to think that the connection strings are a problem for the user.</p>

<p>I’ve decided to host different light/medium size by using PostgreSQL and MariaDB (a modern fork of MySQL) backends. I tend to prefer PostgreSQL because it easier to configure on client and server side, without strange tricks (see the Problems with MySQL/Maria and SQL Server section).</p>

<p>Why these database backends? I think there are a ton of small edge cases when moving between DB back ends and so testing lots with live databases is quite valuable. With this resource you can benchmark speed, compression, and DDL types.</p>

<h2 id="books">Books</h2>

<h3 id="hitchhikers-guide">The Hitchhiker's Guide to Ggplot2 & The Hitchhiker's Guide to Plotnine</h3>

<p><a href="https://leanpub.com/ggplot-guide">The Hitchhiker's Guide to Ggplot2</a> is a plotting book for R users. <a href="https://leanpub.com/plotnine-guide">The Hitchhiker's Guide to Plotnine</a> is a plotting book for Python users.</p>

<p>These are a technical books. The scope of the books is to go straight to the point and the writing style is similar to a recipe with detailed instructions. It is assumed that you know the basics of R and Python and that you want to learn how to create beautiful plots.</p>

<p>Each chapter will explain how to create a different type of plot, and will take you step-by-step from a basic plot to a highly customised graph. The chapters' order is by degree of difficulty.</p>

<p>Every chapter is independent from the others. You can read the whole book or go to a section of interest and we are sure that it will be easy to understand the instructions and reproduce our examples without reading the first chapters.</p>

<h3 id="r4ds-es">R for Data Science in Spanish (R4DS-ES)</h3>

<p>I wrote a large part of R for Data Science translation into <a href="https://es.r4ds.hadley.nz/">Spanish</a>, where I also had to organize the community involved in the translation. This project also features <a href="https://r4ds-soluciones.netlify.app">solutions</a> in Spanish.</p>
